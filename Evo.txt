Project Evolution:

	- Manage a way to change from the child API Controller the name and type of the 'GET' params. (to avoid the problem with 'id' and 'userId')

Status 2:

	Decoupling the notion of the rest Mock API from the State (caching) mechanism
	
		Edit: That can be done implementing 'Store' class.
		
Status 3:

	Evaluate the notion of a 'Model' Store (right now only works with ICollection<T>) 
	
		-> Cache-based ngRx/Redux ? 
		
	Edit:

		Implement:
		
		- Cache-based ngRx/Redux
		
		- ACID transactions for both 'Store' & 'ModelStore' (adding locks to CRUD transactions) 

Status 4:

	Added 'Model Store' class, the Store know handles State objects, but CID not implemented yet. 
	
Status 5:

	Added "Replace Seed" feature in 'ModelStore' based controller
