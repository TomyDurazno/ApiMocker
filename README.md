# ApiMocker
Api Mocker for .NET

The whole idea of the project is to create a simple Mocker that can read an initial state (Seed) and manage mutations of it (by caching)
with out-of-the-box configuration for common Http verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) and the possibility to add more custom functionality with ease.
Its useful to test front-end apps in a daily working situation or a hackaton
